    "question": "I have 10 liters of orange drink that are two-thirds water and I wish to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill one liter of the orange drink. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?",
    "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- I have 10 liters of orange drink that are two-thirds water.\n- I wish to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water.\n- How much water is in the remaining 24 liters.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:** Key values: 10, 15, 24.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:** Initial state: given values (10, 15, 24), total amount not yet calculated.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\nThere are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.\nAfter 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.\nContinue with 2 more calculation step(s) to reach the final value.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:** All operations are valid: no division by zero, no negative counts, and all intermediate values are consistent with the given constraints.

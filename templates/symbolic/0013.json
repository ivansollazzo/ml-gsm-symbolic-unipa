  "question": "Mary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain with?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nYesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 18 plants, she therefore had a total of 80 + 18 = <<80+18=98>>98 potted plants\nTomorrow, Mary\u2019s plant giveaway will be 40 *1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 58",

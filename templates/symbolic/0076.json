  "question": "Deandre caught 3 tunas last Monday, the first tuna he caught weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna he caught weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna he caught weighs 26 kilograms. If a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, how much will he earn after selling all the tunas to the market?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nDeandre will earn 56 x $0.50 = $<<56*0.5=28>>28 from the first tuna.\nHe will earn 46 x $0.50 = $<<46*0.5=23>>23 for the second tuna.\nAnd he will earn 26 x $0.50 = $<<26*0.5=13>>13 from the third tuna.\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the tunas is $28 + $23 + $13= $<<28+23+13=64>>64.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 64",

    "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute.\n- saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.\n- cook 90 shrimp.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:** Key values: 6, 30, 10, 90.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:** Initial state: given values (6, 30, 10, 90), time elapsed is zero.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\nFirst find how long it takes Emily to peel the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes\nThen find how many batches of shrimp she needs to cook: 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp/batch = <<90/30=3>>3 batches\nContinue with 2 more calculation step(s) to reach the final value.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:** All operations are valid: no division by zero, no negative counts, and all intermediate values are consistent with the given constraints. Plan verified.\n**EXECUTION:**\n- First find how long it takes Emily to peel the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes\n- Then find how many batches of shrimp she needs to cook: 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp/batch = <<90/30=3>>3 batches\n- Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 10 minutes/batch = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes\n- Then add the peeling time to find the total time Emily spends: 30 minutes + 15 minutes = <<30+15=45>>45 minutes\n**GOAL CHECK:** All steps completed and verified.

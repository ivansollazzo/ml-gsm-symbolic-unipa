  "question": "There are 96 fourth-graders at Small Tree  School. 43 of them are girls. On Friday, 5 fourth-grade girls and 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. How many fourth grade boys were at Small Tree  School on Friday?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nOf the 96 fourth graders, 43 are girls, so 96 students - 43 girls = <<96-43=53>>53 boys.\nOn Friday there were 53 boys - 4 absent = <<53-4=49>>49 boys.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 49",

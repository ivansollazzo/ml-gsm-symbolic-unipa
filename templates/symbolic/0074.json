    "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Benny saw a 10-foot shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:** Key values: 10, 2, 6.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:** Initial state: given values (10, 2, 6), unknown value not yet computed.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\nFirst, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<6*2=12>>12 inches\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1=1>>1 foot\nContinue with 1 more calculation step(s) to reach the final value.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:** All operations are valid: no division by zero, no negative counts, and all intermediate values are consistent with the given constraints. Plan verified.\n**EXECUTION:**\n- First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<6*2=12>>12 inches\n- Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1=1>>1 foot\n- Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 10 feet * 100% = 10%\n**GOAL CHECK:** All steps completed and verified. The final answer is 10.\n#### 10",

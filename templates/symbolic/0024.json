  "question": "According to its nutritional info, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nIf the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving\nWe also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams\nIf I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 48",

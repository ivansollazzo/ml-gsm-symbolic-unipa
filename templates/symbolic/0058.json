The computation used 7 instead of 8, giving 7 * 2 = 14 instead of the correct 8 * 2 = 16. Rechecking against the problem constraints reveals the discrepancy. **BACKTRACK**.\n**EXECUTION:**\n- He drank 8*2=<<8*2=16>>16 ounces of milk\n- So he drank 16*3=<<16*3=48>>48 calories of milk\n**GOAL CHECK:** Error caught and corrected.

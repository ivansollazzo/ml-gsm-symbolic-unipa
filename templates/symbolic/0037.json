  "question": "A loaf of bread has 24 slices. If Abby can eat 2 slices a day while Josh can eat twice as much, how many days will the loaf of bread last?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nJosh can eat 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 slices a day.\nTogether, Abby and Josh can eat 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 slices a day.\nSo, a loaf of bread will last for 24/6 = <<24/6=4>>4 days.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 4",

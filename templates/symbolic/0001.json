  "question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If the city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nThe city will be covered in 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 intervals of 10 minutes.\nThus, it will take 14 * 10 = <<14*10=140>>140 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 140",

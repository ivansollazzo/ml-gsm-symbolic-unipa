    "question": "When Sophie watches her nephew, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings on it. Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?",
    "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks in it.\n- The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals inside.\n- The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings on it.\n- Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for he....\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:** Key values: 31, 8, 9, 62.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:** Initial state: given values (31, 8, 9, 62), count not yet determined.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\nLet T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Sophie has 31 + 8 + 9 + T = 48 + T = 62 toys for her nephew.\nContinue with 1 more calculation step(s) to reach the final value.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:** All operations are valid: no division by zero, no negative counts, and all intermediate values are consistent with the given constraints.

The computation added 48 instead of subtracting: 62 + 48 = 110 instead of 62-48 = 14.

  "question": "At Allan's house, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. He has a total of 40 cannolis in his house. Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nBefore buying any corn and cannoli, Allan had twice as much corn as cannoli, which is 40 cannoli * 2 corn/cannoli = <<40*2=80>>80 corns\nThe total number of corns and cannolis that Allan had before is 80 corn + 40 corn = <<80+40=120>>120 corn\nWhen he bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, he bought 60 corn - 40 corn = <<60-40=20>>20 corns\nIn total, he bought 20 corns + 60 cannolis = <<20+60=80>>80 items\nAfter the purchases, Allan has 120 items + 80 items = <<120+80=200>>200 total corns and cannolis combined.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 200",

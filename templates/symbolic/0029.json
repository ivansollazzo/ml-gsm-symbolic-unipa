    "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.\n- Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:** Key values: 8, 3, 12, 4.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:** Initial state: given values (8, 3, 12, 4), unknown value not yet computed.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\nFirst find the total number of puppies: 8 puppies + 12 puppies = <<8+12=20>>20 puppies\nThen find the total number of puppies with spots: 3 puppies + 4 puppies = <<3+4=7>>7 puppies\nContinue with 1 more calculation step(s) to reach the final value.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:** All operations are valid: no division by zero, no negative counts, and all intermediate values are consistent with the given constraints.

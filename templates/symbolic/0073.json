    "question": "Sunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for two days?",
    "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.\n- 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday.\n- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday.\n- 15 boxes of apple pie.\n- If the gingerbread cost $6.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:** Key values: 10, 4, 5, 15, 6.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:** Initial state: given values (10, 4, 5, 15), total amount not yet calculated.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\nHe sold 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.\nThe total number of boxes of gingerbread that Sunny sold is 10 + 15 = <<10+15=25>>25.\nContinue with 5 more calculation step(s) to reach the final value.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:** All operations are valid: no division by zero, no negative counts, and all intermediate values are consistent with the given constraints.

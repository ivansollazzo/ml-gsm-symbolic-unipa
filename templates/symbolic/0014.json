  "question": "John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school together. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is. It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. How much longer do they have to get to school without being late?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nJohn and Jack arrive at the library with 30 - 6 = <<30-6=24>>24 minutes left to reach the fire station.\nThey then arrive at the fire station and have 24 - 13 = <<24-13=11>>11 minutes left to get to school without being late.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 11",

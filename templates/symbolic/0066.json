    "question": "Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?",

    "question": "Mary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain with?",

  "question": "Martha is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of them. It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a hat, 4 for a scarf, 12 for a sweater, 1 for a pair of mittens, and 2 for a pair of socks. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nA full outfit for each child will require 2 skeins per hat + 4 skeins per scarf + 12 skeins per sweater + 1 skein per pair of mittens + 2 skeins per pair of socks = <<2+4+12+1+2=21>>21 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3 * 21 = <<3*21=63>>63 skeins of wool.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 63",

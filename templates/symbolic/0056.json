  "question": "A glass of milk is 8 ounces of milk.  John drinks 2 glasses of milk.  If milk has 3 calories per ounce how many calories did he consume?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nHe drank 8*2=<<8*2=16>>16 ounces of milk\nSo he drank 16*3=<<16*3=48>>48 calories of milk\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 48",

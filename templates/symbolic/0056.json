    "question": "The Adams family is busy making cookies. So far, they've made 7995 cookies. They have 2595 rainbow cookies, 3075 oatmeal cookies, and some chocolate chip cookies. How many chocolate chip cookies have they made?",
    "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- So far, they've made 7995 cookies.\n- They have 2595 rainbow cookies, 3075 oatmeal cookies,.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:** Key values: 7995, 2595, 3075.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:** Initial state: given values (7995, 2595, 3075), count not yet determined.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\nThe total number of pieces of rainbow and oatmeal cookies is 2595 + 3075 = <<2595+3075=5670>>5670.\nTherefore, they made 7995 - 5670 = <<7995-5670=2325>>2325 chocolate chip cookies.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:** All operations are valid: no division by zero, no negative counts, and all intermediate values are consistent with the given constraints.

    "question": "Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?",

  "question": "Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nPat's flower bed is 111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = <<111/1.5=74>>74 plants needed.\nPat needs to buy 74 plants - 17 plants = <<74-17=57>>57 plants needed to purchase.\nPat will spend 57 plants * $6 = $<<57*6=342>>342.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 342",

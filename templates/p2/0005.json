  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nThe total ratio representing the ingredients she used to make the coffee is 7+13 = <<7+13=20>>20\nSince the fraction representing the number of teaspoons she used is 7/20, she used 7/20*120 = <<7/20*120=42>>42\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 42",

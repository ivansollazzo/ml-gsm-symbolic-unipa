  "question": "John is raising money for a school trip. He has applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover half the cost of the trip. How much money is John missing if he has $50 and the trip costs $300?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nJohn's school has decided to pay 300 / 2 = $<<300/2=150>>150 for his trip.\nIn total John has covered 150 + 50 = $<<150+50=200>>200 for his trip\nTherefore, John needs 300 - 200 = $<<300-200=100>>100 more for the trip.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 100",

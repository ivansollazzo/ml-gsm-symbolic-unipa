  "question": "Mr. Tan sold his house for $400 000. He paid the transfer fees that amount to 3% of the selling price and also paid a brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price. If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nMr. Tan paid $400 000 x 3/100 = $12 000 for the transfer fees.\nHe paid $400 000 x 5/100 = $20 000 for the brokerage fee.\nSo, Mr. Tan paid a total of $12 000 + $20 000 + $250 000 = $282 000 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.\nHence, Mr. Tan's net proceeds is $400 000 - $282 000 = $118 000.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 118000",

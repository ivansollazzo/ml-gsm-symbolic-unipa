    "question": "Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?",
    "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she ....\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:** Key values: 3.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:** Initial state: given values (3), count not yet determined.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\nIf Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.\nContinue with 5 more calculation step(s) to reach the final value.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:** All operations are valid: no division by zero, no negative counts, and all intermediate values are consistent with the given constraints.

  "question": "Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as her less-experienced colleague Jewel. Daily, Jewel processes 50 customers. What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nWhile Jewel is processing 50 orders in a day, Julie processes 50 orders/day * 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 orders/day.\nIn a day, they process 100 orders/day + 50 orders/day = <<100+50=150>>150 orders together.\nThe total number of orders the two processes in a week is 150 orders/day * 7 days/week = <<150*7=1050>>1050 orders\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 1050",

  "question": "Peter wants to make different sized ice cubes with 32 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 4 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 2 ounces, and small cubes that use 1/2 an ounce. If he makes 3 giant cubes, 7 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes, how many ounces of water does he have left?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nThe giant cubes used up 12 ounces of water because 3 times 4 equals <<3*4=12>>12.\nThe medium cubes used up 14 ounces of water because 7 times 2 equals <<7*2=14>>14.\nThe small cubes used up 4 ounces of water because 8 times 1/2 equals 4.\nThis means that Peter has used up 30 ounces of water because 12 plus 14 plus 4 equals 30.\nPeter has 2 ounces of water left because 32 minus 30 equals <<32-30=2>>2.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 2",

  "question": "In a set of magicians cards, there are 15 red cards, and 60% more green cards. Yellow cards are as many, as the sum of red and green cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nThere are 60/100 * 15 = <<60/100*15=9>>9 more green cards than red cards.\nWhich means there are 15 + 9 = <<15+9=24>>24 green cards.\nYellow cards make up to 15 + 24 = <<15+24=39>>39 cards.\nSo in total, there are 39 + 39 = <<39+39=78>>78 cards of different colors.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 78",

    "question": "A plague infects ten people. Every day, each infected person infects six others. How many people are infected after three days?",
    "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Problem defined by the given question parameters.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:** Key values: see question.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:** Initial state: all given values known, count not yet determined.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\nOn the first day, the original ten people infect six people each, so 10 * 6 = <<10*6=60>>60 more people are infected.\nThere are 10 + 60 = <<10+60=70>>70 infected people after the first day.\nContinue with 3 more calculation step(s) to reach the final value.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:** All operations are valid: no division by zero, no negative counts, and all intermediate values are consistent with the given constraints. Plan verified.\n**EXECUTION:**\n- On the first day, the original ten people infect six people each, so 10 * 6 = <<10*6=60>>60 more people are infected.\n- There are 10 + 60 = <<10+60=70>>70 infected people after the first day.\n- On the second day, 70 * 6 = <<70*6=420>>420 more people are infected.\n- There are 70 + 420 = <<70+420=490>>490 infected people after the second day.\n- On the third day, 490 * 6 = 2940 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 490 + 2940 = 3430 infected people after three days.\n**GOAL CHECK:** All steps completed and verified. The final answer is 3430.\n#### 3430",

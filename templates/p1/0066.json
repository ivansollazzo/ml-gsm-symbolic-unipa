Plan verified.\n**EXECUTION:**\n- Let {d3[0]} be the minutes of TV {name} had watched on {d3}.\n- After {d1}, he had watched {h1} hours = {h1} * 60 = {h1*60} minutes of TV.\n- On {d2}, he watched {h1} * 60 = {h1*60} minutes of TV, so in total he watched {h1*2*60} minutes on {d1} and {d2}.\n- On {d4}, he watched {h2}*60 + {m2} = {h2 * 60} + {m2} minutes of TV. So, in total, he watched {h1*120} + {h2*60} + {m2} = {h1*120 + h2*60 + m2} minutes on {d1}, {d2}, and {d4} combined.\n- On {d5}, he watched {n2} episodes, each {h3} * 60 = {h3*60} minutes, which would be {n2} * {h3*60} = {n2 * h3 * 60} minutes. So far he watched {h1*120 + h2*60 + m2} + {n2*h3*60} = {h1*120 + h2*60 + m2 + n2*h3*60} minutes on {d1}, {d2}, {d4}, and {d5} combined.\n- Finally, on {d6}, he watched {extra} * {extra_mins} = {extra * extra_mins} minutes of TV.\n- So, overall, {name} has watched {h1*120 + h2*60 + m2 + n2*h3*60} + {extra*extra_mins} = {h1*120 + h2*60 + m2 + n2*h3*60 + extra*extra_mins} minutes of TV on {d1}, {d2}, {d4}, {d5}, {d6}.\n- We know that overall, {name} had watched {total} hours of TV, which would be {total} * 60 = {total * 60} minutes. So we know {h1*120 + h2*60 + m2 + n2*h3*60 + extra*extra_mins} + {d3[0]} = {total*60}. Hence, {d3[0]} = {total*60} - {h1*120 + h2*60 + m2 + n2*h3*60 + extra*extra_mins} = {total*60 - (h1*120 + h2*60 + m2 + n2*h3*60 + extra*extra_mins)}.\n- To calculate the number of episodes on {d3}, we divide the total amount of TV watched on {d3} by the episode length: {total*60 - (h1*120 + h2*60 + m2 + n2*h3*60 + extra*extra_mins)} minutes / {m1} minutes per episode = {(total*60 - (h1*120 + h2*60 + m2 + n2*h3*60 + extra*extra_mins))//m1} episodes.\n**GOAL CHECK:** All steps completed and verified.

Combining quantities directly without resolving each intermediate step yields an inconsistent result. **BACKTRACK**.\n**EXECUTION:**\n- Let {d3[0]} be the minutes of TV {name} had watched on {d3}.\n- After {d1}, he had watched {h1} hours = {h1} * 60 = {h1*60} minutes of TV.\n- On {d2}, he watched {h1} * 60 = {h1*60} minutes of TV, so in total he watched {h1*2*60} minutes on {d1} and {d2}.\n- On {d4}, he watched {h2}*60 + {m2} = {h2 * 60} + {m2} minutes of TV. So, in total, he watched {h1*120} + {h2*60} + {m2} = {h1*120 + h2*60 + m2} minutes on {d1}, {d2}, and {d4} combined.\n- On {d5}, he watched {n2} episodes, each {h3} * 60 = {h3*60} minutes, which would be {n2} * {h3*60} = {n2 * h3 * 60} minutes. So far he watched {h1*120 + h2*60 + m2} + {n2*h3*60} = {h1*120 + h2*60 + m2 + n2*h3*60} minutes on {d1}, {d2}, {d4}, and {d5} combined.\n- Finally, on {d6}, he watched {extra} * {extra_mins} = {extra * extra_mins} minutes of TV.\n- So, overall, {name} has watched {h1*120 + h2*60 + m2 + n2*h3*60} + {extra*extra_mins} = {h1*120 + h2*60 + m2 + n2*h3*60 + extra*extra_mins} minutes of TV on {d1}, {d2}, {d4}, {d5}, {d6}.\n- We know that overall, {name} had watched {total} hours of TV, which would be {total} * 60 = {total * 60} minutes. So we know {h1*120 + h2*60 + m2 + n2*h3*60 + extra*extra_mins} + {d3[0]} = {total*60}. Hence, {d3[0]} = {total*60} - {h1*120 + h2*60 + m2 + n2*h3*60 + extra*extra_mins} = {total*60 - (h1*120 + h2*60 + m2 + n2*h3*60 + extra*extra_mins)}.\n- To calculate the number of episodes on {d3}, we divide the total amount of TV watched on {d3} by the episode length: {total*60 - (h1*120 + h2*60 + m2 + n2*h3*60 + extra*extra_mins)} minutes / {m1} minutes per episode = {(total*60 - (h1*120 + h2*60 + m2 + n2*h3*60 + extra*extra_mins))//m1} episodes.\n**GOAL CHECK:** Error caught and corrected.

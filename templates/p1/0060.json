  "question": "Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week. He earns $10 per hour and gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Watson make in April if the company performed very well for the whole month?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nIn a day, Watson makes 10 * 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100\nIf he works five days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 5 * 4= <<5*4=20>>20 days.\nSince he makes $100 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 20 * 100= $<<20*100=2000>>2000.\nHe also got a 300 * 4 = $<<300*4=1200>>1200 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of April.\nAt the end of April, he earned 2000 +1200 = $<<2000+1200=3200>>3200.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 3200",

    "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- John collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes.\n- The first two have 200 apartments each.\n- the last one is 60% bigger than the other two combined.\n- He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place.\n- 40 per collection for each apartment.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:** Key values: 3, 200, 60, 40.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:** Initial state: given values (3, 200, 60, 40), total amount not yet calculated.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\nThe first two complexes have 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 apartments\nThe third one has 400*.6=<<400*.6=240>>240 more apartments than those 2 combined\nContinue with 4 more calculation step(s) to reach the final value.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:** All operations are valid: no division by zero, no negative counts, and all intermediate values are consistent with the given constraints.

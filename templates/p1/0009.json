  "question": "When Sophie watches her nephew, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings on it. Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nLet T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Sophie has 31 + 8 + 9 + T = 48 + T = 62 toys for her nephew.\nThus, T = 62 - 48 = <<62-48=14>>14 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 14",

    "question": "If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?",
    "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Harry have 100 feet of fence between them,.\n- they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, how much is left over ....\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:** Key values: 100, 60.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:** Initial state: given values (100, 60), total amount not yet calculated.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\nLet x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100\nContinue with 2 more calculation step(s) to reach the final value.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:** All operations are valid: no division by zero, no negative counts, and all intermediate values are consistent with the given constraints. Plan verified.\n**EXECUTION:**\n- Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.\n- Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100\n- Subtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40\n- We divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.\n**GOAL CHECK:** All steps completed and verified. The final answer is 20.\n#### 20",

    "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- The area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet.\n- If the length of his room is 3 yards, what is the perimeter of the room in feet.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:** Key values: 360, 3.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:** Initial state: given values (360, 3), unknown value not yet computed.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\nThe length of the room is 3 yards * (3 feet / 1 yard) = <<3*(3/1)=9>>9 feet.\nThe width of the room is 360 square feet / 9 feet = <<360/9=40>>40 feet.\nContinue with 1 more calculation step(s) to reach the final value.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:** All operations are valid: no division by zero, no negative counts, and all intermediate values are consistent with the given constraints. Plan verified.\n**EXECUTION:**\n- The length of the room is 3 yards * (3 feet / 1 yard) = <<3*(3/1)=9>>9 feet.\n- The width of the room is 360 square feet / 9 feet = <<360/9=40>>40 feet.\n- The room's perimeter is 2(40+9) = 98\n**GOAL CHECK:** All steps completed and verified.

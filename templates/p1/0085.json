  "question": "If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nLet x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100\nSubtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 20",

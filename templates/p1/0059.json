    "question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If the city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?",
    "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city.\n- If the city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how man....\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:** Key values: 10, 3, 42.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:** Initial state: given values (10, 3, 42), time elapsed is zero.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\nThe city will be covered in 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 intervals of 10 minutes.\nThus, it will take 14 * 10 = <<14*10=140>>140 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:** All operations are valid: no division by zero, no negative counts, and all intermediate values are consistent with the given constraints. Plan verified.\n**EXECUTION:**\n- The city will be covered in 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 intervals of 10 minutes.\n- Thus, it will take 14 * 10 = <<14*10=140>>140 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n**GOAL CHECK:** All steps completed and verified.

The computation multiplied 42 * 3 = 126 instead of dividing 42 / 3 = 14.

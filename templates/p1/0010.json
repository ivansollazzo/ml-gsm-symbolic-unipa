  "question": "To make a call from a payphone, you must pay $0.25 for each minute of your call. After 16 minutes, that price drops to $0.2 per minute. How much would a 36-minute call cost?",
  "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Compute the requested quantity from the given values.\n- Keep units and operations consistent through each step.\n- Return only the final numeric result after the reasoning.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:**\n- Identify intermediate values before the final computation.\n- Apply arithmetic in a valid order and track units carefully.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:**\n- All required inputs are provided in the prompt.\n- No calculation has been executed yet.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\n- Follow a direct computation path using the given quantities and needed intermediate steps.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:**\n- The plan is valid because it preserves the problem constraints and unit consistency.\n**EXECUTION:**\nFirst 16 minutes would be a cost of 16 * 0.25 = $<<16*0.25=4>>4.\nAfter that, there are 36 - 16 = <<36-16=20>>20 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 20 minutes cost 20 * 0.2 = $<<20*0.2=4>>4.\nSo in total, the 36-minute call would cost 4 + 4 = $8.\n**GOAL CHECK:**\n- The computed value answers the requested target quantity.\n#### 8",

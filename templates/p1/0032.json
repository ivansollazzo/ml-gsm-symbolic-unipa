  "question": "Mrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $400 000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $350 000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?",

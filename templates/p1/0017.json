    "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- A hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied.\n- Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day.\n- Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:** Key values: 1000, 1, 5, 50, 2.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:** Initial state: given values (1000, 1, 5, 50), solution not yet derived.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\nIf 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.\nThe total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.\nContinue with 3 more calculation step(s) to reach the final value.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:** All operations are valid: no division by zero, no negative counts, and all intermediate values are consistent with the given constraints. Plan verified.\n**EXECUTION:**\n- If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.\n- The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.\n- If 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.\n- After two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.\n- If there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.\n**GOAL CHECK:** All steps completed and verified.

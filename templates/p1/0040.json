    "answer": "**RULES UNDERSTANDING:**\n- In a set of magicians cards, there are 15 red cards,.\n- 60% more green cards.\n**HINTS UNDERSTANDING:** Key values: 15, 60.\n**STATE OBSERVATION:** Initial state: given values (15, 60), count not yet determined.\n**ACTION PROPOSAL:**\nThere are 60/100 * 15 = <<60/100*15=9>>9 more green cards than red cards.\nWhich means there are 15 + 9 = <<15+9=24>>24 green cards.\nContinue with 2 more calculation step(s) to reach the final value.\n**CONSTRAINT VERIFICATION:** All operations are valid: no division by zero, no negative counts, and all intermediate values are consistent with the given constraints.
